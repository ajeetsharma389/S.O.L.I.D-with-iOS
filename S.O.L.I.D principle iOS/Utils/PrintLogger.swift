 The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
 "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
 
 // ##########  Problem ######
 If you want to create a class that is easy to maintain, it must have two important characteristics:

 1) Open for extension: You should be able to extend or change the behaviors of a class without efforts.
 2) Closed for modification: You can extend a class without changing the implementation.

/*
 If you want to add the possibility to print also the details of a some new class, we would have to change the implementation of printData of PrintLogger class every time we want to log a new class so breaking OCP
 
 We can solve this problem creating a new 'protocol' Printable, which will be implemented by the classes to log. Finally, printData will print an array of Printable.

 In this way, we create a new abstract layer between printData and the class to log, allowing the print of other classes like Bicycle and without changing the printData implementation.
